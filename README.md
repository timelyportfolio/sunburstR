### Help Me/Pay Me to Use, Improve, and Extend

`sunburstR` has already seen extensive use in many projects across multiple domains.  If you have any interest in collaborating with me on this project or applying `sunburstR`, please let me know (see [Time Isn't Money](https://buildingwidgets.com/2016-12-09_post_break/)).


# sunburstR

Easily make these interactive `d3.js` sequence sunburst charts in `R` originally modeled on this [example](https://gist.github.com/kerryrodden/7090426) from Kerry Rodden.  In addition, `sunburstr` provides another beautiful and functional version using [`d2b`](https://github.com/d2bjs/d2b) from Kevin Warne.

### Examples

See the [examples](https://github.com/timelyportfolio/sunburstR/tree/master/inst/examples).

### Improve/Iterate

These are still far from feature-complete.  I would love your input, feedback, and comments.
